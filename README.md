# Having fun with the BBC micro:bit

This python code in this repository can be compiled to a .hex file using the
[mu editor](http://codewith.mu/) or the
[python microbit online editor](http://python.microbit.org/editor.html).

Connecting your [BBC micro:bit](https://www.microbit.org/) to your computer
using a USB cable will make it appear as a USB mass storage (just as a standard
USB key).

Once you have the .hex file, copy it to the "folder", the led at the back of
the board will blink rapidly while it's flashing it. Once it's done flashing,
everything is ready to enjoy ;)
